They say laughter is the best medicine. I'm not really sure who "they" are or what sickness laughter is best for but who am I to question them? What I do know is that laughter is contagious (It might be a virus) but it's a lot more fun than the flu.
So go get a dose of the [laughsquare](http://laughsquare.com).
